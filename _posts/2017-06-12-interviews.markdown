As I'm currently interviewing with companies for a new web developer position, I felt that it's fair to share some of the recent projects I've worked on here with you...


[Supreme Sports Performance and Training][sspt-site] : Supreme Sports Performance and Training is a training gym for professional powerlifters. I did onsite consulting and training directly with the client to help them manage their own branding and online presence. This was a Wordpress migration to Squarespace w/ custom documentation added for self-sufficient ongoing management by the client.

[Swellgear.com][swellgear-site] : With only the brand and a styleguide directly from the designer, I was able to assemble a modified theme that quickly served their entire needs. That, combined with a special Javascript applet that carefully pulled & formatted custom listings from eBay to create a custom shim of their online store inside their website. The client was beyond delighted once they received their site and documentation in less than a week's time from start to finish.

[Edge Education][edge-ed] : Edge Ed is a VA-based testing prep organization that I have worked with over the years. Previously, I had maintained their site on Wordpress. Currently, it runs Drupal 7 w/ commerce features.
