As a hybrid web/print designer of nearly 20 years, Iâ€™ve enjoyed the opportunity to work on myriad projects in TV, news, online media, magazines, music, and much more.

Right now, however, my full re-education into advanced web development tools has been the most challenging, and by adding more steadily to this Github site, I hope to showcase steady improvement and useful programs/applets/etc. worth sharing.

Check out my Portfolio site to see my complete up-to-date projects and clients that I have worked with as a freelance designer. I also post a lot of my own music and mixes online my Soundcloud profile. Get at me online via Twitter.
